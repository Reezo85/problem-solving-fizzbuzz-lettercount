# Problem Solving Exercise – FizzBuzz & Letter Count

Student: Reginald Boyd  
Course: Springboard Software Engineering Career Track

## Purpose
Practice solving classic JavaScript problems using:
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Input validation
- Objects (for counting letters)

This project contains two functions:
1. **FizzBuzz** – Prints "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" based on divisibility rules.
2. **Letter Count** – Counts how many times each letter appears in a word.

## Files
- `FizzBuzz_LetterCount.js` — Contains both solutions.

## FizzBuzz Summary
- Accepts a number `n`
- Valid range: **1–100**
- Prints:
  - `"FizzBuzz"` if divisible by 3 and 5  
  - `"Fizz"` if divisible by 3  
  - `"Buzz"` if divisible by 5  
  - Otherwise, prints the number

Example:
```js
fizzBuzz(16);
// Output shows 1 through 16 with Fizz/Buzz replacements
